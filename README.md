# Adyen API library for Node.js

This is a fork of the official
[Adyen SDK](https://npmjs.com/package/@adyen/api-library) with Deno
compatibility, see
[denoland/deno#26733](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/26733) for more
information.

Please use the official version unless you are using Adyen with Deno, and the
upstream issue is still open.
